# Anjana V – Portfolio

## 👋 Hi, I'm Anjana!

I come from a software development background with 3 years of experience as a Python developer, primarily working on backend systems in the domain of data analytics. Over time, I developed a strong interest in working directly with data, leading me to pivot into the field of **Data Analytics** and **Business Intelligence**.

Through independent learning and hands-on practice, I’ve built a solid foundation in tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, and **SQL**, and I'm currently enhancing my skills further through coursework in **Data Science** and **AWS**. My interest lies in transforming raw data into impactful insights and building dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.

During my professional journey, I have worked extensively on data-centric modules involving data ingestion, transformation, preparation, and visualization. My experience includes developing backend services for analytical workflows, building and maintaining various data connectors, and contributing to major components such as the Data Center, Data Preparation, and Data Catalog. These projects have strengthened my skills in data engineering and analytics, while sharpening my problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication abilities.

I’m excited to apply my skills to meaningful projects and collaborate with teams that value data-driven approaches. I am now seeking opportunities as a **Data Analyst** or **BI Developer** where I can apply these skills to solve real-world business problems.
