## 👋 Hi, I'm Anjana

**Data Analyst | Former Python Backend Developer | BI & Dashboard Specialist**

With 3 years of experience as a Python backend developer working on data-centric systems, I transitioned into Data Analytics to work closer to business decision-making and strategic insights.

I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights using **Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Excel, and Python**. My focus is on designing interactive dashboards, developing KPIs, identifying performance trends, and enabling data-driven decisions.

I am currently seeking opportunities as a **Data Analyst** or **BI Developer** in Bangalore where I can combine analytical thinking, technical expertise, and business understanding to solve real-world problems.
